# odin-calculator
Finally completed this project. It took me a lot more time than I expected. Design was the easiest thing but most time I wasted writing code for evaluation. Only got progress when started writing pseudocode which showed me how much was wrong with code that I wrote earlier.
Project is finished but still have couple details that I could improve:
-active effect don't work on button when using keypad
-result should go to history class when user starts to write new formula

It's not perfect but it's my own calculator and I'm happy about it :)
